# Term Project Assignment
Simulating a Ride-Sharing Service Dispatch System

Overview
This term project focuses on building a discrete event simulation (DES) to optimize the allocation of Uber and Lyft drivers to locations based on driving patterns and weather components. By simulating various scenarios involving these factors, the goal is to predict ride-sharing prices, and determine optimal strategies for deploying drivers and adjusting ride prices based on real-time conditions.

The project will utilize the Uber-Lyft Price Prediction dataset available on Kaggle, and the simulation will consider various aspects such as:

- Driver Availability and Location: Predicting driver demand and supply across different locations based on driving patterns.
- Weather Impact: Incorporating weather data to understand its effect on ride prices and driver availability.
- Optimization: Using simulation results to optimize the allocation of drivers to high-demand areas while considering weather forecasts, driving time, and traffic conditions.
